This project is designed to help you understand and practice the core concepts and commands of Git, a powerful version control system widely used in software development. 
It introduces foundational Git commands such as git init to initialize a new repository, git add to stage changes, and git commit to save snapshots of your work.
The git status command is frequently used to check the current state of your working directory and staging area, while git log provides a detailed history of your commits.
Using git branch we can create and manage branches, switch between them with git checkout, and combine changes using git merge.
In addition to local Git operations, this project also introduces essential commands for working with remote repositories. The git remote add command is used to link your local repository to a remote server, such as GitHub or GitLab. This connection allows you to collaborate with others and back up your code online.
Once a remote is added, you can use git push to upload your local commits to the remote repository, making your changes accessible to other team members. Similarly, the git pull command is used to fetch and merge updates from the remote repository into your local project, ensuring youâ€™re always working with the latest version of the code.
By completing this project, you will gain confidence in creating new files, modifying existing ones tracking changes through version control, using Git in both solo and collaborative environments, laying the groundwork for more advanced Git workflows such as remote repositories, pull requests, and rebasing.
